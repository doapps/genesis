# Genesis
Genesis is the official project builder from [DoApps](http://doapps.me/). It provides all necessary project structure for managing and start up a new project.

## Status
Genesis is currently in development and hence unstable (Until its soon launch :rocket:). For now is a super-basic tool but the goal is automatize all the manual work.

## Approach
This project aims to build the project structure given by this repository. i.e. Will build the same tree from the `project` directory.
The app will begin asking for the project name, namespace and device targets. This will require the permissions for Google Drive (our main store house-keeper), Slack(for channel creation) and Gitlab(for project repositories). Anyway you can fork this repository and customize by your own interest.

## Repository Structure
The `app` folder keeps the React based web application. Meanwhile the `project` folder stores the template-structure.

## Current features
Will be posted soon.

## Possible future features
There are a RFC file which handle the proposals and comments for change in the building process of the structure.

## TODO list
- [x] Main Screens (Mockup)
- [ ] Web App
- [ ] Third Party Integrations
- [ ] Testing
